# RISC-V Pipelined Processor with Vedic Multiplier
A RISC-V 32-bit pipelined processor with an integrated Vedic multiplier for efficient multiplication operations. This project includes a five-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) and supports additional multiplication instructions using the Vedic multiplication technique. It is designed in Verilog and tested using simulation and synthesis tools.
